# TingedSlate
Based on CleanSlate by ck2plus team, this mod focus on governments, laws and offmap_powers enhancement.
It is actually a branch of CleanSlate, but splited into a repo so I can dev and debug along with CleanSlate
And loaded as a submod along with main CleanSlate in the same time

Ultimately, it will squash back to a branch of CleanSlate.
