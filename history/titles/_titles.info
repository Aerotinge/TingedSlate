When setting up a title history, do following standards below

d_example
#########
330.1.1 = {									# earliest date available is "2.1.1"
	set_global_flag	= it_doesnt_matter		# global command, executed immediately and can be resolved by government below
	vice_royalty = yes						# misc hardcoded title command such as "vice_royalty", "historical_nomad", "holding_dynasty", "capital", "de_jure_liege"
	liege = k_big_dude						# liege/set_tribute_suzerain has to be first
	holder = 321654							# holder can be later
	government = custom_government			# apply government after then if any, validation executed immediately. Can only do once in a title.
	# Low prio
	name = "good_tag"						# NAME
	adjective = "good_tag_ADJ"				# ADJ
	# Not executed till start
	law = succ_primogeniture				# laws of the title, only executed once the game starts
	effect = {}								# effect, only executed once the game starts
}

340.1.1 = {
	liege = 0								# Don't forget to clean up liege/clear_tribute_suzerain. Or else the liege consider there's a vassal/tributary with this title
	vice_royalty = no						# ...and so did the hardcoded title flags if have to
	holder = 0								# If there's no longer a holder (e.g dies/title destroyed)
}
