# Russification
# In the 9th century, Rus/Suomi are Norsemen who trading/raiding in Staraja Ladoga, around 843; buliding a fort, Rurikovo Gorodishche, nearby Novgorod nowadays, in 859; Askold and Dir go for Kiev, around 866.
# Circa. 867, few of them adopted Christianity. But most of them were still pagan in next a hundred years.
# Around 879, the Ruriks in Novgorod moved south-ward. In 882, they occupied Kiev and expelled Dir, assimilated nearby the slavic tribes in decades.
# The chaos ended in 890s. The Ruriks forming Kievan Rus then and expanding to the sphere of influence of the Khazar khanate

# In 976, they're still Norsemen but adopted/shared many things with their slavic people, like religion.
# However, in 988, Vladimir of Kievan Rus converted to the Orthodoxy.
# By the end of 10th century, he and his man had seperated from their Nordic borthers, who was still Norse pagan or converted to the Catholicism. 
# In the 11th century, Paganism is still strong in Kiev. e.g. An uprising took place in Kiev, bringing to power Vseslav of Polotsk who supported the traditional Slavic paganism in 1068. And Novgorod had pagan uprising as late as 1071.
# While outside Kiev, Christianization of the countryside was the work, not of the 11th and 12th Century, but of the 16th or even 17th.


# In the same time, their cultural self-identification also shift to the local people. The Rus' elite became bilingual.

# By A.D 1043, the Grand Princes of Rus' are more a Slavic than a Norseman. By the end of this century that Old East Slavic become their native language. Norse names used ever less for naming.
# With the Slavicization of the Rus' elite completed after the second half of the 11th century, the Rus' people were, by and large, Orthodoxy Slavics in the 12th century.

# Severians
# The Rus' imposed their rule on the Severians and gradually assimilated them into their culture. By the 12th century, the Severians had largely disappeared as a distinct nation.
# Their existence remained in Tale of Bygone Years, compiled in around 1113. Mentioned Severians in as late as 1024

# Volhynians
# They were conquered by the Rus' in the 10th century, but they retained their own language and culture.
# The Volhynian principality was founded in the 12th century, and it lasted until the 14th century, the conquest of Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

# Ilmenians
# Their existence remained in Tale of Bygone Years, compiled in around 1113. Mentioned Ilmenians in as late as 1036

# Meshcherians and Meryans(Mordvin in Merya)
# In the Oka River valley, the Meshchera culture appears to have disappeared by the 11th century.
# In the marshy north, they appear to have stayed. The Meshchera nobility appears to have been converted orthodox and assimilated by the 13th century,
